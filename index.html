            <p>I am an full-stack interactive developer with a passion for front end and UI development and a career spanning two decades. The content below is a small sample of my work. Enjoy!</p>

                <h1>Visual Design</h1>
            </header>
            <p>Although I work primarily as an interactive developer, at times I am required to make design decisions. This is especially important when leading up to a pair programming or design-in-the-browser session. I typically work in Photoshop CC for raster and Sketch for vector graphics.</p>
            <p>Here are a few PDF samples.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h2>Powerful Candles</h2>
                    <p>Powerful Candles is the umbrella brand for a hand-crafted candle startup that plans to grow from a single micro-brand to multiple brands and associated target markets.</p>

                    <h2>Candlepower</h2>
                    <p>Candlepower is the first Powerful Candles brand to go to market. They are sold at farmers&lsquo; markets and craft fairs around northeast Ohio.</p>

                <h1>Interactive Exercises</h1>
            </header>
            <p>These exercises represent standardized client content from Expand Interactive, where I worked as a front end developer. Designs were created as a team, at the whiteboard or in the browser.</p>
            <p>All exercises were written with proprietary autoplay audio. This has been removed at the request of the content owner.</p>
            <p>All drag and drop interactions occur only in one direction for better voice command accessibility.</p>
            <p>Text-on-screen contrast passes WCAG AA and AAA guidelines.</p>
            <p>All UI elements that use color for feedback also appropriately use text or iconography for visual reinforcement.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h2>Button Choice</h2>
                    <p>This is a binary choice exercise with clickable images for user input.</p>

                    <h2>Order Sort</h2>
                    <p>This sorting exercise features draggable responses and a &ldquo;check your answers&rdquo; button, allowing the user to try multiple times if needed.</p>

                    <h2>True False</h2>
                    <p>This true/false exercise uses a swipe-left/swipe-right mechanism below the mobile breakpoint, and uses more of the container width at larger sizes.</p>
